# Pedro Valadares
<sub>*Electrical Engineering Student at Unicamp | Data Science Student at Sigmoidal* </sub>

Excellent communication skills, team-oriented personality and results driven professional. Experienced in telecommunications, data science, signal processing, acoustics, automation and enthusiastic about 5G, 6G, IoT, machine learning and programming.

Recently, I received a scholarship from FAPESP to work as an undergraduate researcher, implementing an individualized equalization filter, for over-ear headphone reproduction, capable of improving 3D immersive audio experiences.

As for other extracurricular experiences, I am part of 3E Unicamp-Electrical Engineering Junior Enterprise, where I could work on my hard skills and also soft skills, being part of a phenomenal team and developing solutions and prototypes for IoT and automation projects.

I am also a member of IEEE (world´s largest technical professional organization), being part of Unicamp´s Student Branch, where I helped to open a BTS Chapter (Broadcast Technology Society) and performed volunteer work teaching basic programming logic to children.

**Background in:** Python, Matlab, C++, Arduino IDE, Statistics.
